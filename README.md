## Hey
I'm Lucas. I am a 21 year old Software Engineer who loves learning and programming. My main interests are in writing and optimizing code with a focus on performance, working with random numbers to create beautiful landscapes and most recently in learning about Shaders and computer graphics, both new and old!

My Discord is 2401Lucas#2401

## Experience
I am proficient in C, C++, GLSL & HLSL
I have worked with Unity, Unreal and the Godot engine, as well as projects without engines.

### Released Games
[PGA 2k23](https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/pga-tour-2k23)
I worked mostly on the FTUE/Tutorial of the game, as well as the practice range. My work included using an in house UI system, maintaining, updating and adding new features to the named area's of the game as well as testing features across platforms(PC,PS4/PS5, XB1/XBX) 

### Personal Projects
I spend most of my weekends trying new projects, learning and occasionally sharing my work when I think it is interesting.

####  Procedurally Generating Landscape
This was my first big project, I learned how to do, as well as the importance of Multithreading, creating Mesh in code, writing a Shader for textures, baking Vertices and Uvs manually as well as LOD optimizations as initially performance was very poor.   

#### Vulkan Renderer
