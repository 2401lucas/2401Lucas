## Hey

I'm Lucas. I really enjoy programming and am currently working on projects to reflect my abilities. 

I have a mostly programmed in C#, with experience in C, C++, Python, TypeScript, and Cg/HLSL(Unity's Shader Language)
I am experienced in both Unity and Unreal, as well as the ArduinoIDE

My biggest project so far is my Procedural Landscape Project using unity's built in Perlin Noise. It creates completely random terrain with a seed that goes for a seemingly endless amount of time. I learned how to do Multithreading, creating Mesh in code, Writing a Shader for textures and baking Vertices and Uvs manually.
