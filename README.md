## Hey
I'm Lucas. I really enjoy programming and am currently working on projects to reflect my abilities. I really enjoy optimizing and designing code as efficiently as possible. 
My Discord is 2401Lucas#2401

## Experience
I have a mostly programmed in C#, with experience in C, C++, Python, TypeScript, and Cg/HLSL(Unity's Shader Language)
I am experienced in both Unity and Unreal, as well as the ArduinoIDE.
### Work Experience
I've also worked with a golf company on creating a prototype to pitch for an app idea in Unity, working with 2 artists and myself as the Programmer.

Currently I am working with HB Studios, based in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia as a Junior Programmer.

### Personal Projects
My biggest project so far is my Procedural Landscape Project using unity's built in Perlin Noise. It creates completely random terrain with a seed that goes for a seemingly endless amount of time. I learned how to do Multithreading, creating Mesh in code, Writing a Shader for textures and baking Vertices and Uvs manually.   

I've also worked with a MiniMax algorith for a Tic Tac Toe game. i've learned a lot about recursion and algorithms. I really enjoyed it and plan on continuing my work with algorithms.
