## Hey
I'm Lucas. I am a 21 year old Software Engineer who loves learning and programming. My main interests are in writing and Optimizing code with a focus on performance, working with random numbers to create beautiful landscapes and most recently in learning about Shaders and computer graphics, both new and old!

My Discord is 2401Lucas#2401

## Experience
I am proficient in C, C++, GLSL & HLSL
I have worked with Unity, Unreal and the Godot engine, as well as projects without engines.
 
### Work Experience
Currently I am working with HB Studios, based in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia as a Junior Software Engineer.

### Personal Projects
I spend most of my weekends trying new projects, learning and occasionally sharing my work when I think it is interesting.

####  Procedurally Generating Landscape
This was my first big project, I learned how to do, as well as the importance of Multithreading, creating Mesh in code, writing a Shader for textures, baking Vertices and Uvs manually as well as LOD optimizations as initially performance was very poor.   

#### Game Engine work --- https://www.gameenginebook.com
Recently I have picked up this book, I really enjoy learning all about how engines work and am working on designing my own engine, based on a fork of Godot with a focus on performance and being a lightweight enigne.

#### Unreal Engine 5 --- Procedural Planet 
I have been working on creating a procedural planet, this includes creating a sphere in code and applying noise to distort the sphere to more resemble a planet. I have spent time optimizing their mesh generation at on an engine level. I plan on creating a shader to add colour to the planet, which led me to my next project, learning more about Shaders.

#### Tunnel Shader --- https://www.shadertoy.com/view/sldyz4
I have been heavily inspired by Inigo Quilez(IQ on shadertoy) to start experimenting with shaders. I really enjoy working with noise and plan to continue my work with shaders. For this Shader, I learned a lot about raymarching and have a new appreciation for IQ's work. I plan on continuing to my work with shaders as I find a great interest.

#### Spaceship tunnel game ---
Currently I am working on a little game based on the tunnel shader, it is being made in Unity, I have created a Vertex Tunnel shader and some Editor Tools to help design the tunnel. I plan on keeping this game small and polished, eventually releasing it on the Apple AppStore/Google Play store. This is being made in partnership with [Laurence](https://github.com/SirLorrence) who is working on all of the Gameplay programming. 

## My favourite games
#### Crash Bandicoot - PS1
I owe much of my interest in games to the original Crash Bandicoot on the ps1, I have countless hours playing all those levels from a very young age. After listening to [Andy Gavin talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izxXGuVL21o&ab_channel=ArsTechnica) about what went into the making of this game, I have found a profound level of respect to what it took to make. 

#### Super Smash Bro's Brawl --- Wii
This is the start to my journey in competitive games, playing many hours against my brother.

#### Grand Turismo 5 -- PS3
This was my first racing game, everything from the large collection of cars and the amazing soundtracks blew me away as a kid. This really jumpstarted my love of cars and racing games.

#### Apex Legends - PC / Mobile
I love playing apex, from the movement system, longer TTK's and competive modes, it quickly became on of my goto favorites.

#### Chess - https://www.chess.com/member/2401lucas
I have only started playing chess seriously a few months ago and it very quickly became one of my go to games. It requires much concentration and focus, feeling like a game based around problem solving, which I enjoy a lot.
